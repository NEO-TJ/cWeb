              The project is not only recognized and approved by the government of Thailand but has the unique distinction of being in a duty free zone which has significant advantages for both of the company and our customers with vastly simplified documentation, direct importation of gold bullion, gemstones and other materials and much quicker export shipment lead-time etc. Intercontinental otherwise work with 5 other factories in Thailand which are sub-contracted to manufacture Intercontinental's designs and using Intercontinental's models. Our Stone Department supplies these factories with diamonds and colored stones. The company produces gold and silver jewellery and specializes in all major product groups and particularly for product with high labor content.
