              We commissioned our state of the art manufacturing facility in the duty free zone within the Amata Nakorn Industrial Estate in May 2005 as an approved Board of Investment (BOI) Project. The facility provides for future growth and once fully utilised will have an annual capacity of 1,400,000 pieces.

The Intercontinental Jewellery Group's foreseeable visions includes an imminent IPO on Thailand's MAI Stock Exchange in order to give the group financial independence, provide the corporate framework for planned expansion, consolidate customer base and to maximize shareholders' wealth. In addition, we are focused on further growth from new customers particularly within the many emerging markets.

We place a high priority on both corporate and social responsibility. The company is ISO 9001 version 2000 approved, we comply strictly to the Kimberley Process and other protocols, and our manufacturing is environmentally friendly. We are committed to a scheme to reward giving long-term incentives to all our valuable employee.

The Intercontinental Jewellery Manufacturing Public Company Limited Group has proven successful growth in each of the last three years and the financial result each year has been commendable.
